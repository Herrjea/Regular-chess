# Regular-chess

Simple chess game, mainly to try to write something in Java. Currently in Spanish (tho not very hard to understand, given it only has three things to say =D) and still under development (has no fancy pawn first move, castling, promotion and beyond).
After it's completed (hopefully during next summer break) I'll use it as start point for another chess-based game =D
